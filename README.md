**Structure of the project, file and folder**
Structure of the project- files and folders.
The project consists of four folders and each folder has files inside and some other files in the root directory as to editconfig, gitignore, reedme, fivicon and and index.html file. The block folder has all the css files, the image folder all the images used in the project and the page folder the index css file which linked all files in the block folder to be imported. The vendor folder has a font folder and a font file and the normalize file.
The project is composed of a header, a main content and a footer. The header has the logo and an horizontal line. The main is composed a profile section and a card section. The profile has an images, a profile info-profile title, an edit button and a profile description, and an add button. the card section section is an unorderd list of cards which containes an images, a card description a, card name and a like button. of nine images designed into cards and the footer the name of the author and the date.  
We have a desktop side, one break point and a mobile size for this project. The desktop and the break point display the se same output as to the cards are in three rows and three colums while the in the mobile all the cards are in one column.
the technology we use:
The header is jsut a logo and an horizontal bar. we have used the figma design to implement the trquired propeties of the ;ogo as to margin, max-width. we have used the header botton for the line.

**The profile section in main:**
The profile section in the main:
We have used css rule background transparent to add the edit and the add button. we have also followed th figma design to properly implement the corresponding margin. We have also used the block code .block {text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;overflow: hidden;} to fide text overflow. We have used css media query rules to delimite the destop form the mobile sise and the breakpoint to have the page responsiveness in all devices.
for the destop size: we use flex box technology to position the whole profile and grid technology to dysply the profile info specifically. we use disply flex to automatically align the different elments in the whole profile horizontally. we used grid template are to disply the profile info as to the title, description and the button.
for the mobile size: we used flexbox for bothe the whole profile and the profile info.

**The card section in the main:**
Each card has has an image, a card description with the name of the card and like button.
for the card section in the main:
for the desktop size: to disply the cards, we have used grid technology. we used css display grid and grid template column aufit to properly disply the cards.
for the mobile size:
since we use grid for the desktop size, the card are automatically fit themselve in the mobile size in one column.
